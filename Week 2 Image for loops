Question 1
Add code inside the loop to modify flowers.jpg like this: set each pixel to have green of 0, leaving the red and blue values unchanged. The result should be that the flowers look red, since the yellow was made of red+green light.

image = new SimpleImage("flowers.jpg");

for (pixel: image) {
  // Your code here
  pixel.setGreen(0);
}
print(image);

Question 2 
Add code inside the loop to modify flowers.jpg like this: set each pixel to have red 255, green 0, blue 0.

image = new SimpleImage("flowers.jpg");

for (pixel: image) {
  // Your code here
  pixel.setRed(255);
  pixel.setGreen(0);
  pixel.setBlue(0);
}
print(image);
